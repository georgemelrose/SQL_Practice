## 1 Working with Dates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Date and Time functions in SQLite

Key date and time functions in SQLite -

-   DATE() - While SQLite doesn't have a TIMESTAMP function like in MySQL, this function returns the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

```{sql Using Date function}
SELECT DATE('now') AS "Current Date"; -- returns the current date
```

-   DATETIME() - This function returns the date and time in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.

```{sql Using DateTime function}

SELECT DATETIME('now') AS "Current Date and Time"; -- returns the current date and time
```

-   YEAR(): SQLite doesn't have a YEAR function, but one can use the STRFTIME function to extract the year from a date.

```{sql STRFTIME function}
SELECT STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') AS "Current Year"; -- returns the current year
```

-   TIME(): Returns the time in 'HH:MM' format.

```{sql TIME function}
SELECT TIME('now') as "Current Time"; -- returns the current time
```

```{sql CURRENT_DATE function }
SELECT CURRENT_DATE as "Current Date"; -- returns the current date

```

```{sql CURRENT_TIME function }
SELECT CURRENT_TIME as "Current Time"; -- returns the current time

```

```{sql CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function }
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as "Current Time and Date"; -- returns the current date and time

```

### Manipulating dates in 'Bookstore' Tables

```{sql getting status date from order history table}

SELECT status_date as "Status Date" from order_history;

```

```{sql filtering customer id and order by time period}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-11-01'
and '2024-05-01' ORDER BY order_date DESC;
```

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date \< Now();

The above SQL code isn't possible as there isn't a Now() function in SQLite.

```{sql filtering columsn from cust order where order date is less than current time and date}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

```

```{sql filtering columns from cust order where order date is more than current time and date}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

```

SQLite doesn't have a YEAR() function but it does have a TIME() function to use.

```{sql filtering columns from cust order where order date time is more than current date time}
SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE TIME(order_date) > TIME(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

```

## 2 - Common SQL String Functions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### SUBSTRING()

The function SUBSTRING() returns a part of a character string SUBSTRING(*string, start, length*)

```{sql using substring}

select title as "Book Title" from book WHERE SUBSTRING(Title,1,2) = 'Ro'

```

### CONCAT()

The CONCAT(*string1, string2,....,string_n*) function joins two or more strings together

```{sql using concat}

select CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS "Full Name" from customer

```

Double pipes, \|\| , can also be used in place of CONCAT(), in SQLite.

```{sql using concat double pipe}

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "Full Name"
FROM customer;
```

### UPPER() and LOWER()

The UPPER() and LOWER() functions will return strings as upper case or lower case, respectively.

```{sql using the UPPER function}
select UPPER(CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)) AS "Full Name" from customer
```

```{sql using the LOWER function}
select LOWER(CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)) AS "Full Name" from customer
```

### REPLACE()

The REPLACE() function replaces a substring with another substring - REPLACE(*string, old_string, new_string*)

```{sql Using the REPLACE function }
select REPLACE(language_id, '1', "English") as Language from book where language_id = '1'
```

### Using TRIM, LTRIM, and RTRIM in SQLite

```{sql original titles from book}

select title as "Title" FROM book

```

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing characters (default is space).

```{sql removing trailing white spaces using the trim function of the titles from the book table}

select TRIM(title)  as "Trimmed Title" FROM book

```

TRIM with specific characters: Removes specified characters from both ends.

```{sql trimming the characters the from the title of the book table}

SELECT TRIM(title, 'The') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;

```

LTRIM with specific characters: Removes specified leading characters.

```{sql Removing leading characters (default is space)}
SELECT LTRIM(title, 'What') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

```{sql removing leading characters - the}
SELECT LTRIM(title, 'The') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

RTRIM with specific characters: Removes specified trailing characters.

```{sql removing specific trailing characters}
SELECT RTRIM(title, 's') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

LTRIM and RTRIM can be used in combination with one another -

```{sql removing specific trailing characters from start and end}
SELECT RTRIM(LTRIM(title, 'The'), 's') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

### Combining different String Functions

```{sql Generating an Address function from the address table}

select UPPER(CONCAT(street_number,' ',street_name,' ',city)) as "Address" from address LIMIT 6

```

### Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) Functions

```{sql checking the publisher table}
select * from Publisher
```

```{sql Creating new rows in the publisher table}

INSERT INTO Publisher (publisher_id, publisher_name) VALUES ('1001', 'UoG Press')
```

```{sql Checking insert from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql Updating table information}

UPDATE Publisher SET publisher_id = '1002' WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql Checking update from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql deleting rows from a table}

DELETE FROM Publisher WHERE publisher_id = '1002'

```

```{sql Checking delete from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"

```

## 3 - Visualising Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Python Method from the LinkedIn Learning Course

```{python importing relevant python modules}
import pandas as pd

import sqlalchemy as sa

import plotly.express as px

import plotly.graph_objects as go

from sqlalchemy.engine import create_engine
```

```{python making a run query command}
# 
# def run_query(query):
#     return pd.read_sql(query, con=connection)
# 
# df = run_query("SELECT * FROM cust_order",con=connection )
```

### Bar Charts

```{r yearly orders bar chart}

#creating a new column to mark each order as a 1#
cust_order <- cust_order %>%
  mutate(number_orders = 1)

#converting the order date column into a date format#
cust_order$order_date <- as.Date(cust_order$order_date)

cust_order$order_date <- ymd(cust_order$order_date)

#simply bar chart of the no.orders, put into an object to be run through plotly#
p <- ggplot(cust_order, aes(x = order_date, y = number_orders)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = " Simple Bar Chart", x = "Order Date", y = "No.Orders") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


#display the bar chart#
p
```

We can use the ggplotly from the plotly package to make the plot interactive.

```{r using ggplotrly to make an interactive bar chart}
p <- ggplotly(p)

p
```

```{r group cust_order data by month}

cust_order_monthly  <- cust_order %>% 
  select(order_date, number_orders) %>%
  group_by(month = lubridate::floor_date(`order_date`, 'month'))  %>%
  summarise("no_orders_monthly" = sum(number_orders))


p <- ggplot(cust_order_monthly , aes(x = month, y = no_orders_monthly)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Monthly orders from the 'Cust_order' Table", x = "Order Date", y = "No.Orders") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

p

```

Making the plot interactive -

```{r making the monthly bar chart interactive}
p <- ggplotly(p)

p
```

### Dygraphs

<https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/> - An extremely useful way of visualising longitudinal data in an interactive, highly-customisable manner.

```{r dygraph of above data}


don <- xts(x = cust_order_monthly$no_orders_monthly, order.by = cust_order_monthly$month)

p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Monthly No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 


p
```

```{r daily orders dygraph}

#Create 'Unzoom' function#

dyUnzoom <-function(dygraph) {
  dyPlugin(
    dygraph = dygraph,
    name = "Unzoom",
    path = system.file("plugins/unzoom.js", package = "dygraphs")
  )
}

cust_order_daily  <- cust_order %>% 
  select(order_date, number_orders) %>%
  group_by(day = lubridate::floor_date(`order_date`, 'day'))  %>%
  summarise("no_orders_daily" = sum(number_orders))

cust_order_daily$day <- as.POSIXct(cust_order_daily$day)


don <- xts(x = cust_order_daily$no_orders_daily, order.by = cust_order_daily$day)

p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 


p
```

The time series can be 'filled' using the dyoptions() argument 'fillgraph' (TRUE/FALSE).

```{r filled in white space below ts}
p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
    dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```

The function *dyEvent()* allows vertical lines with a label to be added. *dyAnnotation()* generates annotations directly on the time series line. Using a custom function, a larger annotation and attached to the x-axis is also possible, *presAnnotation()* . *dyshading()* allows whole areas of the graph to be shaded -

```{r annotating and highlighting the dygraph}

presAnnotation <- function(dygraph, x, text) {
  dygraph %>%
    dyAnnotation(x, text, attachAtBottom = TRUE, width = 60)
}


p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
    dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyEvent("2023-08-24", "Andy's Order", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyEvent("2023-10-06", "Bob's Order", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2023-09-13", text = "Sep.", tooltip = "September 241 Offer") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2023-11-13", text = "Nov.",tooltip = "November Multibuy Offer" ) %>%
  presAnnotation("2024-05-29", text = "BHol" ) %>%
  dyShading(from = "2024-04-01", to = "2024-05-01", color = "#CCEBD6") %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```

The function *dyLimit()* allows line limits to be added.

```{r line limits }
p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyLimit(8, color = "blue") %>%
  dyLimit(40, color = "blue") %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```
