## 1 Working with Dates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Date and Time functions in SQLite

Key date and time functions in SQLite -

-   DATE() - While SQLite doesn't have a TIMESTAMP function like in MySQL, this function returns the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

```{sql Using Date function}
SELECT DATE('now') AS "Current Date"; -- returns the current date
```

-   DATETIME() - This function returns the date and time in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.

```{sql Using DateTime function}

SELECT DATETIME('now') AS "Current Date and Time"; -- returns the current date and time
```

-   YEAR(): SQLite doesn't have a YEAR function, but one can use the STRFTIME function to extract the year from a date.

```{sql STRFTIME function}
SELECT STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') AS "Current Year"; -- returns the current year
```

-   TIME(): Returns the time in 'HH:MM' format.

```{sql TIME function}
SELECT TIME('now') as "Current Time"; -- returns the current time
```

```{sql CURRENT_DATE function }
SELECT CURRENT_DATE as "Current Date"; -- returns the current date

```

```{sql CURRENT_TIME function }
SELECT CURRENT_TIME as "Current Time"; -- returns the current time

```

```{sql CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function }
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as "Current Time and Date"; -- returns the current date and time

```

### Manipulating dates in 'Bookstore' Tables

```{sql getting status date from order history table}

SELECT status_date as "Status Date" from order_history;

```

```{sql filtering customer id and order by time period}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-11-01'
and '2024-05-01' ORDER BY order_date DESC;
```

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date \< Now();

The above SQL code isn't possible as there isn't a Now() function in SQLite.

```{sql filtering columsn from cust order where order date is less than current time and date}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

```

```{sql filtering columns from cust order where order date is more than current time and date}

SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE order_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

```

SQLite doesn't have a YEAR() function but it does have a TIME() function to use.

```{sql filtering columns from cust order where order date time is more than current date time}
SELECT customer_id as "Customer ID", order_date as "Order Date" from cust_order WHERE TIME(order_date) > TIME(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

```

## 2 - Common SQL String Functions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### SUBSTRING()

The function SUBSTRING() returns a part of a character string SUBSTRING(*string, start, length*)

```{sql using substring}

select title as "Book Title" from book WHERE SUBSTRING(Title,1,2) = 'Ro'

```

### CONCAT()

The CONCAT(*string1, string2,....,string_n*) function joins two or more strings together

```{sql using concat}

select CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS "Full Name" from customer

```

### UPPER() and LOWER()

The UPPER() and LOWER() functions will return strings as upper case or lower case, respectively.

```{sql using the UPPER function}
select UPPER(CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)) AS "Full Name" from customer
```

```{sql using the LOWER function}
select LOWER(CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)) AS "Full Name" from customer
```

### REPLACE()

The REPLACE() function replaces a substring with another substring - REPLACE(*string, old_string, new_string*)

```{sql Using the REPLACE function }
select REPLACE(language_id, '1', "English") as Language from book where language_id = '1'
```

### Using TRIM, LTRIM, and RTRIM in SQLite

```{sql original titles from book}

select title as "Title" FROM book

```

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing characters (default is space).

```{sql removing trailing white spaces using the trim function of the titles from the book table}

select TRIM(title)  as "Trimmed Title" FROM book

```

TRIM with specific characters: Removes specified characters from both ends.

```{sql trimming the characters the from the title of the book table}

SELECT TRIM(title, 'The') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;

```

LTRIM with specific characters: Removes specified leading characters.

```{sql Removing leading characters (default is space)}
SELECT LTRIM(title, 'What') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

```{sql removing leading characters - the}
SELECT LTRIM(title, 'The') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

RTRIM with specific characters: Removes specified trailing characters.

```{sql removing specific trailing characters}
SELECT RTRIM(title, 's') AS "Trimmed Title" FROM book;
```

### Combining different String Functions

```{sql Generating an Address function from the address table}

select UPPER(CONCAT(street_number,' ',street_name,' ',city)) as "Address" from address LIMIT 6

```

### Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) Functions

```{sql checking the publisher table}
select * from Publisher
```

```{sql Creating new rows in the publisher table}

INSERT INTO Publisher (publisher_id, publisher_name) VALUES ('1001', 'UoG Press')
```

```{sql Checking insert from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql Updating table information}

UPDATE Publisher SET publisher_id = '1002' WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql Checking update from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"
```

```{sql deleting rows from a table}

DELETE FROM Publisher WHERE publisher_id = '1002'

```

```{sql Checking delete from previous chunk worked}

select * from Publisher WHERE publisher_name == "UoG Press"

```

## 3 - Visualising Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Python Method from the LinkedIn Learning Course

```{python importing relevant python modules}
import pandas as pd

import sqlalchemy as sa

import plotly.express as px

import plotly.graph_objects as go

from sqlalchemy.engine import create_engine
```

```{python making a run query command}
# 
# def run_query(query):
#     return pd.read_sql(query, con=connection)
# 
# df = run_query("SELECT * FROM cust_order",con=connection )
```

### Bar Charts

```{r yearly orders bar chart}

#creating a new column to mark each order as a 1#
cust_order <- cust_order %>%
  mutate(number_orders = 1)

#converting the order date column into a date format#
cust_order$order_date <- as.Date(cust_order$order_date)

cust_order$order_date <- ymd(cust_order$order_date)

#simply bar chart of the no.orders, put into an object to be run through plotly#
p <- ggplot(cust_order, aes(x = order_date, y = number_orders)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = " Simple Bar Chart", x = "Order Date", y = "No.Orders") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


#display the bar chart#
p
```

We can use the ggplotly from the plotly package to make the plot interactive.

```{r using ggplotrly to make an interactive bar chart}
p <- ggplotly(p)

p
```

```{r group cust_order data by month}

cust_order_monthly  <- cust_order %>% 
  select(order_date, number_orders) %>%
  group_by(month = lubridate::floor_date(`order_date`, 'month'))  %>%
  summarise("no_orders_monthly" = sum(number_orders))


p <- ggplot(cust_order_monthly , aes(x = month, y = no_orders_monthly)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Monthly orders from the 'Cust_order' Table", x = "Order Date", y = "No.Orders") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

p

```

Making the plot interactive -

```{r making the monthly bar chart interactive}
p <- ggplotly(p)

p
```

### Dygraphs

<https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/> - An extremely useful way of visualising longitudinal data in an interactive, highly-customisable manner.

```{r dygraph of above data}


don <- xts(x = cust_order_monthly$no_orders_monthly, order.by = cust_order_monthly$month)

p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Monthly No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 


p
```

```{r daily orders dygraph}

#Create 'Unzoom' function#

dyUnzoom <-function(dygraph) {
  dyPlugin(
    dygraph = dygraph,
    name = "Unzoom",
    path = system.file("plugins/unzoom.js", package = "dygraphs")
  )
}

cust_order_daily  <- cust_order %>% 
  select(order_date, number_orders) %>%
  group_by(day = lubridate::floor_date(`order_date`, 'day'))  %>%
  summarise("no_orders_daily" = sum(number_orders))

cust_order_daily$day <- as.POSIXct(cust_order_daily$day)


don <- xts(x = cust_order_daily$no_orders_daily, order.by = cust_order_daily$day)

p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 


p
```

The time series can be 'filled' using the dyoptions() argument 'fillgraph' (TRUE/FALSE).

```{r filled in white space below ts}
p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
    dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```

The function *dyEvent()* allows vertical lines with a label to be added. *dyAnnotation()* generates annotations directly on the time series line. Using a custom function, a larger annotation and attached to the x-axis is also possible, *presAnnotation()* . *dyshading()* allows whole areas of the graph to be shaded -

```{r annotating and highlighting the dygraph}

presAnnotation <- function(dygraph, x, text) {
  dygraph %>%
    dyAnnotation(x, text, attachAtBottom = TRUE, width = 60)
}


p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
    dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyEvent("2023-08-24", "Andy's Order", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyEvent("2023-10-06", "Bob's Order", labelLoc = "bottom") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2023-09-13", text = "Sep.", tooltip = "September 241 Offer") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2023-11-13", text = "Nov.",tooltip = "November Multibuy Offer" ) %>%
  presAnnotation("2024-05-29", text = "BHol" ) %>%
  dyShading(from = "2024-04-01", to = "2024-05-01", color = "#CCEBD6") %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```

The function *dyLimit()* allows line limits to be added.

```{r line limits }
p <- dygraph(don,xlab = "Order Date", ylab = "No.Orders",main = "Daily No.Orders from 'cust_order' Table ") %>%
  dySeries("V1", label = "No.Orders") %>%
  dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE, fillAlpha = 0.1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyLimit(8, color = "blue") %>%
  dyLimit(40, color = "blue") %>%
  dyUnzoom() 
 

p
```

## 4 - Indexes & Views {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

This section takes inspiration but not much content, from the LinkedIn learning course ***"Intermediate SQL for Data Scientists"*** - <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/intermediate-sql-for-data-scientists>

```{r gravity bookstore dataset erd png repeated}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gam55/Downloads/gravity_bookstore_erd.png")

```

### Indexes

Indexes in SQLite are structures designed to improve the speed of data retrieval. They're similar to indexes in a book, allowing for faster access to rows in a table based on the values of one or more columns.

Types of Indexes -

1.  ***Single-Column Index*** - Created on a single column.

2.  ***Multi-Column Index*** - Created on two or more columns.

3.  ***Unique Index*** - Ensures that all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.

4.  ***Primary Key Index*** - Automatically created when a table has a primary key constraint.

5.  ***Automatic Indexes*** - Sometimes SQLite creates indexes automatically to optimize query performance, particularly for joins.

```{sql creating a single column index}

CREATE INDEX Customer_IDs ON cust_order(customer_id); 


```

```{sql creating a multi column index}

CREATE INDEX Customer_Orders ON cust_order(order_id, customer_id);

```

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_countries ON country(country_name);

This SQL code above fails - A unique index does not discard non-unique values or automatically filter out duplicates. Instead, it enforces a constraint that prevents duplicates from being inserted into the table in the first place.

```{sql creating a unique index}

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_status_ids ON order_status(status_id);

```

List all indexes associated with a table -

```{sql looking at all indexes associated with cust_order}
PRAGMA index_list(cust_order);
```

Get information about a specific index -

```{sql getting information about the customer_orders index specifically}

PRAGMA index_info(Customer_Orders);

```

Indexes can be dropped using the DROP INDEX statement -

```{sql removing the Cusomter_Order index}

DROP INDEX Customer_Orders;

```

Checking the index deletion has worked -

```{sql checking index deletion has worked}
PRAGMA index_list(cust_order);
```

An example with a more complex and intricate query -

```{sql looking at the book table}

select * from book

```

```{sql looking at author names}

select author_name from author where author_name == "Walter Scott"

```

Creating an index of author names.

```{sql creating an index of author names}

CREATE INDEX Author_names ON author(author_name);

```

Now our 'sever' should use that index to optimise the performance of this query.

```{sql filtering Galaxy bokstore data for 1997 to 2000 publications by JK Rowling and Bill Bryson}

SELECT
    b.title,
    b.isbn13,
    b.num_pages,
    b.publication_date,
    a.author_name,
    ol.price
FROM book b
INNER JOIN book_author ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
INNER JOIN author a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
INNER JOIN order_line ol ON b.book_id = ol.book_id
INNER JOIN cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE a.author_name IN ('J.K. Rowling', 'Bill Bryson')
  AND strftime('%Y', b.publication_date) IN ('1997','1998', '1999','2000')
ORDER BY ol.price DESC;


```

### Views

Views in SQLite are virtual tables that provide a way to represent the results of a query as a table.

Reasons to use Views -

1.  **Simplify Complex Queries** - By encapsulating complex joins and calculations within a view, queries can be simpler and more understandable.

2.  **Enhance Security** - Views can restrict access to specific data by exposing only certain columns or rows to users.

3.  **Provide Abstraction** - Offer a layer of abstraction, allowing changes in the underlying database schema without affecting the end users.

4.  **Improve Maintainability** - Views centralise query logic, making the system easier to maintain and modify.

```{sql creating a view of all of Bill Brysons books}
CREATE VIEW Bryson_Books AS
SELECT
    b.title,
    b.isbn13,
    b.num_pages,
    b.publication_date,
    a.author_name,
    ol.price
FROM book b
INNER JOIN book_author ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
INNER JOIN author a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
INNER JOIN order_line ol ON b.book_id = ol.book_id
INNER JOIN cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE a.author_name IN ('Bill Bryson');


```

```{sql creating a view of all of JK Rowling books}
CREATE VIEW Rowling_Books AS
SELECT
    b.title,
    b.isbn13,
    b.num_pages,
    b.publication_date,
    a.author_name,
    ol.price
FROM book b
INNER JOIN book_author ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
INNER JOIN author a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
INNER JOIN order_line ol ON b.book_id = ol.book_id
INNER JOIN cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE a.author_name IN ('J.K. Rowling');


```

```{sql creating a view of all of Walter Scotts books}
CREATE VIEW Walter_Scott_Books AS
SELECT
    b.title,
    b.isbn13,
    b.num_pages,
    b.publication_date,
    a.author_name,
    ol.price
FROM book b
INNER JOIN book_author ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
INNER JOIN author a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
INNER JOIN order_line ol ON b.book_id = ol.book_id
INNER JOIN cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE a.author_name IN ('Walter Scott');


```

```{sql looking at all the columns and rows from the Bryson Books view}
SELECT * FROM Bryson_Books;
```

```{sql looking at all the columns and rows from the Walter Scott Books view}
SELECT * FROM Walter_Scott_Books;
```

Views themselves are not directly updatable, but they can be dropped and recreated -

```{sql dropping the Bryson books view}
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS Bryson_Books;
```

```{sql checking what views are present}
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='view';
```

```{sql seeing the definition of the Walter Scott view}
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='view' AND name='Walter_Scott_Books';
```

## 5 - Statistical aggregate functions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### SUM(), AVG(), ROUND()

The SUM() function is an aggregate function that calculates the total sum of a numeric column. The function is commonly used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to calculate sums for specific groups of data.

```{r gravity bookstore dataset erd png for section 5}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gam55/Downloads/gravity_bookstore_erd.png")

```

```{sql using the sum() function incorrectly}
SELECT SUM(street_name) as "No.different Street Names", SUM(city) as "No.different Cities"  FROM address;
```

As street_name and city are text columns, sum won't work properly on them. It's best to use COUNT(DISTINCT()).

```{sql using the sum() function}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT street_name) as "No. of Different Street Names", 
       COUNT(DISTINCT city) as "No. of Different Cities" 
FROM address;
```

```{r gravity bookstore dataset erd png for section 5 repeat}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gam55/Downloads/gravity_bookstore_erd.png")

```

```{sql using the sum() function correctly}

SELECT 
    SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
FROM 
    order_line ol
INNER JOIN 
    cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
INNER JOIN 
    customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY 
    "Order per Customer" DESC;

```

The AVG() function in SQL is an aggregate function that calculates the average value of a numeric column. It sums up all the values in the column and divides by the number of non-null values, providing the mean value.

```{sql using the sum() and avg() functions}

SELECT 
    SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
    AVG(ol.price) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
FROM 
    order_line ol
INNER JOIN 
    cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
INNER JOIN 
    customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY 
    "Order per Customer" DESC;

```

The ROUND() function in SQL is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places. It takes two arguments: the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places to round to.

```{sql using the sum() and avg() and round() functions}

SELECT 
    SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
    ROUND(AVG(ol.price),2) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
FROM 
    order_line ol
INNER JOIN 
    cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
INNER JOIN 
    customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY 
    "Order per Customer" DESC;

```

### Variance

The VARIANCE() function is used to calculate the statistical variance of a set of numeric values, which measures the dispersion of the values from their mean. However, SQLite does not have a built-in VARIANCE() function.

To calculate variance in SQLite, one can use a combination of SQL functions.

-   *Calculating Sample Variance* -

The sample variance estimates the variance from a sample of the population. The formula is -

\[ \sigma\^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1} \]

-   (\[\sigma\^2\]) is the population variance

-   (\[x_i\]) represents each data point

-   (\[\bar{x}\]) is the sample mean

-   (\[n - 1\]) is the total number of data points in the population

Used when there's only a sample and need the population variance needs to be estimated. The denominator is \[n - 1\] . \[n - 1\] instead of \[n\] to correct the bias in the estimation of the population variance from a sample (Bessel's correction).

The SQL code -

SELECT SUM((value - avg_value) \* (value - avg_value)) / (COUNT(\*) - 1) AS sample_variance FROM ( SELECT value, AVG(value) AS avg_value FROM table_name ) AS subquery;

```{sql calculating sample variance of customers orders}

WITH OrderStats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
        AVG(ol.price) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
        COUNT(ol.price) AS "Order Count",
        CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
    FROM 
        order_line ol
    INNER JOIN 
        cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
    INNER JOIN 
        customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
)
SELECT
    os."Sum of Orders per Customer",
    ROUND(os."Average Order Price per Customer", 2) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
    os."Full Name",
    ROUND(SUM((ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer") * (ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer")) / (os."Order Count" - 1), 2) AS "Order Price Sample Variance"
FROM
    order_line ol
INNER JOIN
    cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
INNER JOIN
    customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN
    OrderStats os ON c.customer_id = os.customer_id

-   *Calculating Population Variance* -

The population variance measures the dispersion of all data points in a population from the population mean ((\[\mu\])). The formula is -

\[ \sigma\^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N} \]

-   (\[\sigma\^2\]) is the population variance

-   (\[x_i\]) represents each data point

-   (\[\mu\]) is the mean of the population

-   (\[n\]) is the total number of data points in the population

With large datasets, the difference between sample and population variance is minimal since the correction factor (n - 1) vs. (n) has a smaller impact as the sample size increases.

The SQL code -

SELECT AVG((value - avg_value) \* (value - avg_value)) AS population_variance FROM ( SELECT value, AVG(value) AS avg_value FROM table_name ) AS subquery;

```{sql calculating population variance of customers orders}

WITH OrderStats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
        AVG(ol.price) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
        COUNT(ol.price) AS "Order Count",
        CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
    FROM 
        order_line ol
    INNER JOIN 
        cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
    INNER JOIN 
        customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name

### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean, indicating how spread out the data points are. A low standard deviation means the data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates they are more spread out.

SQLite does not have a built-in STDDEV() or STDEV() function for calculating standard deviation.

These are the steps to calculate standard deviation in SQLite:

1.  Calculate the mean of the dataset.

2.  Compute Squared Differences calculate the squared difference of each value from the mean.

3.  Aggregate and Calculate - Sum up the squared differences, divide by the count of values (for population standard deviation) or by (n - 1) (for sample standard deviation), and take the square root of the result.

The population standard deviation ((\sigma)) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \]

where: - (\sigma) is the population standard deviation, - (x_i) represents each data point, - (\mu) is the mean of the population, - (N) is the total number of data points in the population.

The SQL code -

SELECT SQRT(AVG((value - avg_value) \* (value - avg_value))) AS population_stddev FROM ( SELECT value, AVG(value) OVER () AS avg_value FROM table_name ) AS subquery;

```{sql calculating population standard deviation}
WITH OrderStats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
        AVG(ol.price) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
        COUNT(ol.price) AS "Order Count",
        CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
    FROM 
        order_line ol
    INNER JOIN 
        cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
    INNER JOIN 
        customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
)
SELECT
    os."Sum of Orders per Customer",
    ROUND(os."Average Order Price per Customer", 2) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
    os."Full Name",
    ROUND(SUM((ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer") * (ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer")) / os."Order Count", 2) AS "Order Price Population Variance",
    ROUND(SQRT(SUM((ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer") * (ol.price - os."Average Order Price per Customer")) / os."Order Count"), 2) AS "Order Price Standard Deviation"
FROM
    order_line ol
INNER JOIN
    cust_order co ON ol.order_id = co.order_id
INNER JOIN
    customer c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN
    OrderStats os ON c.customer_id = os.customer_id
GROUP BY
    os.customer_id, os."Sum of Orders per Customer", os."Average Order Price per Customer", os."Full Name"
ORDER BY
    "Sum of Orders per Customer" DESC;

```

The sample standard deviation ((s)) is calculated using the formula:

\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} \]

where: - (s) is the sample standard deviation, - (x_i) represents each data point in the sample, - (\bar{x}) is the sample mean, - (n) is the number of data points in the sample.

The SQL code -

SELECT SQRT(SUM((value - avg_value) \* (value - avg_value)) / (COUNT(\*) - 1)) AS sample_stddev FROM ( SELECT value, AVG(value) OVER () AS avg_value FROM table_name ) AS subquery;

```{sql calculating sample variance and standard deviation}

WITH SampledCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.first_name,
        c.last_name
    FROM 
        customer c
    ORDER BY 
        RANDOM()
    LIMIT 50
),
OrderStats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        SUM(ol.price) AS "Sum of Orders per Customer",
        AVG(ol.price) AS "Average Order Price per Customer",
        COUNT(ol.price) AS "Order Count",
        CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS "Full Name"
    FROM 
        order_line ol
    INNER JOIN

    INNER JOIN 
        SampledCustomers c ON co.customer_id = c.customer_id

## 6 - WITH() function

WITH(), also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), allows for improved readability and reusability of SQL queries. It's particularly useful for breaking down complex queries into simpler, more manageable parts by creating temporary result sets that can be referenced within the main query.

WITH cte_name AS ( -- CTE Query SELECT ... ) SELECT ... FROM cte_name

[**Key Differences**]{.ul}

1.  **Structure and Readability -**

*Subqueries* - Can be less readable, especially when nested.

*WITH()* - Provide a clearer, more structured approach by defining temporary tables with meaningful names.

2.  **Reusability** -

*Subqueries -* Generally not reusable; you need to repeat the subquery if it's used in multiple places.

*WITH()* - Reusable within the main query, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

3.  **Debugging and Maintenance** -

*Subqueries -* Harder to debug and maintain due to their nested nature.

*WITH() -* Easier to debug and maintain due to their clear, modular structure.

**When using WITH()**

```{sql getting total amount spent and average order amount using the with clause}
WITH CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        co.customer_id, 
        co.order_date,
        ol.order_id,
        SUM(ol.price) AS "Total Order Amount"
    FROM 
        cust_order co
    INNER JOIN 
        order_line ol ON co.order_id = ol.order_id
    WHERE 
        co.order_date BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2024-05-01'
    GROUP BY 
        co.customer_id, co.order_date, ol.order_id
)
SELECT
    c.customer_id AS "Customer ID",
    c.order_date AS "Order Date",
    COUNT(c.order_id) AS "Number of Orders",
    SUM(c."Total Order Amount") AS "Total Amount Spent",
    AVG(c."Total Order Amount") AS "Average Order Amount"
FROM
    CustomerOrders c
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id
ORDER BY
    c.order_date DESC;
```

The part with the WITH inner query -

-   This CTE calculates the total amount spent on each order for every customer within the specified date range.

-   It joins the cust_order and order_line tables and groups the data by customer ID, order date, and order ID to compute the total order amount.

The rest, the outer query -

-   The main query selects from the CustomerOrders CTE.

-   It calculates the number of orders, total amount spent, and average order amount for each customer.

-   The results are grouped by customer ID and ordered by the order date in descending order.

**When not using WITH()**

```{sql getting total amount spent and average order amount without the with clause}
SELECT 
    co.customer_id AS "Customer ID",
    co.order_date AS "Order Date",
    COUNT(orders_per_customer.order_id) AS "Number of Orders",
    SUM(orders_per_customer."Total Order Amount") AS "Total Amount Spent",
    AVG(orders_per_customer."Total Order Amount") AS "Average Order Amount"
FROM 
    cust_order co
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        co_inner.customer_id, 
        co_inner.order_date,
        ol_inner.order_id,
        SUM(ol_inner.price) AS "Total Order Amount"
    FROM 
        cust_order co_inner
    INNER JOIN 
        order_line ol_inner ON co_inner.order_id = ol_inner.order_id
    WHERE 
        co_inner.order_date BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2024-05-01'
    GROUP BY 
        co_inner.customer_id, co_inner.order_date, ol_inner.order_id
) AS orders_per_customer ON co.customer_id = orders_per_customer.customer_id AND co.order_date = orders_per_customer.order_date
WHERE 
    co.order_date BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2024-05-01'
GROUP BY 
    co.customer_id, co.order_date
ORDER BY 
    co.order_date DESC;

```

The part with the INNER JOIN inner query -

-   The inner query calculates the total amount spent on each order for every customer within the specified date range.

-   This inner query is essentially the same as the WITH part in the previous example.

The rest, the outer query -

-   The outer query joins the cust_order table with the result of the inner query (orders_per_customer).

-   It calculates the number of orders, total amount spent, and average order amount for each customer, grouped by customer ID and order date.

-   The results are ordered by the order date in descending order.

**The advantages to using WITH()**

-   *Readability* Using the WITH clause (CTE) makes the query more readable.In the non-CTE version, the nested query can be harder to follow.

-   *Maintainability* The CTE version is more maintainable because each part of the query is isolated. If you need to adjust the calculation logic, it's clearer where to make changes.

-   *Length*:\* The non-CTE version tends to be more long-winded, as it requires embedding the subquery directly in the FROM clause, making the overall query longer and potentially more confusing.
