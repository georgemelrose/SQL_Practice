The concepts outlined by the SQL code below are taken from this LinkedIn learning course, ***"SQL Server Fundamentals: Master Basic Query Techniques"*** - www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-server-fundamentals-master-basic-query-techniques

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pacman::p_load(readr,tidyverse, data.table,DBI,odbc,RSQLite)

options(max.print = 1000) 
getOption("max.print")

con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = ":memory:")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "con")


# List the tables present in the database connected through 'con'
tables <- dbListTables(con)

# Print the list of tables
print(tables)
```

```{r reading in data to the pretend database, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# List of table names (should match the original table names)
tables <- c("country", "ranking_criteria", "ranking_system",
            "university","university_ranking_year","university_year") # Replace with your actual table names

# Loop through each table and read it from the CSV file
for (table in tables) {
  # Read the table from the CSV file
  data <- read_csv(paste0(table, ".csv"))
  
  # Write the table to the new SQL connection
  dbWriteTable(con, table, data, overwrite = TRUE)
}

rm(data)
```

```{r Print the tables currently in the database, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# List the tables present in the database connected through 'con'
tables <- dbListTables(con)

# Print the list of tables
print(tables)
```

```{sql list all the tables from the database, include=FALSE}
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
```

## Single Table 'Select' Statements {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### All Columns

Gathering all columns from a table.

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT * FROM university ;

```

### Some Columns

Gathering selected columns from a table.

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id, year, num_students FROM university_year;

```

### Selecting the top results

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id, year, num_students
FROM university_year
ORDER BY num_students DESC
LIMIT 3;


```

### Changing results' column headers

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id[University ID], year[Year], num_students[No.Students]
FROM university_year
ORDER BY num_students DESC
LIMIT 3;


```

## Filtering on Single Conditions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Finding rows fulfilling a condition

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id[University ID], year[Year], num_students[No.Students]
FROM university_year
WHERE year = '2014';

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id[University ID], year[Year], num_students[No.Students]
FROM university_year
WHERE year != '2014';

```

Note that != & \<\> are synonymous they both mean - not equal to.

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT university_id[University ID], year[Year], num_students[No.Students]
FROM university_year
WHERE year <> '2014';

```

### Finding rows fufilling a list

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name IN ('Belarus','Ukraine','Russia');

```

### Finding rows not fufilling a list

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name NOT IN ('Belarus','Ukraine','Russia');

```

### Finding rows starting and ending with certain characters/a string

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name LIKE 'Un%';

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name NOT LIKE 'Un%';

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name LIKE '%land';

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name NOT LIKE '%sia';

```

### Finding rows containing a string

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT country_name[Country]
FROM country
WHERE country_name LIKE '%United%';

```

### Finding rows based off of numerical parameters

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_female_students between 50 and 60

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students <50

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students >= 50

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students > 50

```

```{sql, max.print = 10}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students IS NULL

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students IS NOT NULL

```

## Filtering on Multiple Conditions {.tabset .tabset-fade}

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students >30 AND pct_female_students >50 AND year = 2012

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university_year
WHERE pct_international_students >30 AND pct_female_students >50 AND year = 2012

```

```{sql, max.print = 5}

SELECT *
FROM university
WHERE university_name LIKE '%London%' or university_name LIKE '%Paris%' OR university_name LIKE '%Glasgow'

```

## Inner Joins {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Necessary, compared to a subquery, if you need to reference columns needed from filtering, like the name of a University below.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gam55/Downloads/universities_erd.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gam55/Downloads/joins.png")
```

### Single Join

```{sql, max.print = 10}

SELECT *
FROM university u
INNER JOIN university_year y
ON u.id = y.university_id
WHERE university_name = 'Imperial College London' OR university_name = 'University of Glasgow'

```

### Multiple Joins

```{sql}

SELECT *
FROM university u
INNER JOIN university_year y
ON u.id = y.university_id
INNER JOIN country c
ON u.country_id = c.id
WHERE c.country_name = 'United Kingdom' AND u.university_name = 'University of Cambridge'

```

## Outer Joins {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Left Outer Join

```{sql}

SELECT u.university_name, y.year, y.num_students, y.pct_international_students
FROM university_year y
LEFT OUTER JOIN university u
ON u.id = y.university_id
WHERE university_name = 'University of St Andrews'

```

```{sql}

SELECT u.university_name, y.year, y.num_students, y.pct_international_students
FROM university_year y
LEFT OUTER JOIN university u
ON u.id = y.university_id
WHERE y.num_students < 10000

```

## Subqueries {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Can only be used when you don't need to return columns from the subquery tables - we don't need to see the number of students below.

Can sometimes be better for filtering than INNER JOINs.

```{sql}
SELECT score, ranking_criteria_id, university_id
FROM university_ranking_year
WHERE university_id
IN (SELECT university_id
FROM university_year WHERE num_students < 10000
)
ORDER BY score DESC
```

## Case Statements {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

There are times when you want to present the data differently than in the way it's available to you in your table, or you might want to show different texts depending on the data state. And that's where case statements come in.

First is a scalar variable, which is declared and then named with the \@ symbol at the front. Then SQL server is told, what kind of data is going to be held in this variable. In this case it is an *integer* type. A variable can be assigned to this variable.Divisible is a column alias.

A case statement is a conditional statement.

First, we declare that this is a case.

Then, when @number is divided by 2, the remainder is 0 - an even number.

When @number is divided by 3, the remainder is 0 - divisible by 3.

The percent sign here is called modulo - *"The modulo operator in SQL is typically represented by the % symbol, and it is used to return the remainder of a division operation."*

The *else* isn't strictly required but it's good practice as otherwise the statement will return NULL.

The SQL code below from the LinkedIn learning course doesn't work in RStudio - SQLite doesn't support support variable declarations


"declare @number int = 5

SELECT divisible = case 
when @number % 2 = 0 then 'divisible by 2'
when @number % 3 = 0 then 'divisible by 3'
else 'does not meet criteria'
end" 


A more basic query is needed - 

```{sql simple case when}
SELECT 
    CASE 
    WHEN 5 % 2 = 0 THEN 'divisible by 2'
    WHEN 5 % 3 = 0 THEN 'divisible by 3'
    ELSE 'does not meet criteria'
    END AS divisible

```

```{sql case when statement for new variable size}
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.university_name AS University,
    y.student_staff_ratio AS "Students:Staff",
    y.num_students AS "No.Students",
    y.pct_international_students AS "% International Students",
    y.pct_female_students AS "% Female Students",
    CASE 
        WHEN y.num_students < 10000 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN y.num_students BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN y.num_students > 20000 THEN 'Large'
        ELSE 'NA' 
    END AS Size
FROM 
    university u
INNER JOIN 
    university_year y
ON 
    u.id = y.university_id
ORDER BY y.pct_international_students DESC;


```


## Built-in Functions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

We can use CAST() to change the 'data type' of a column into something else, like numeric to integer. This is the same as using as.numeric() or as.factor() in R. Unfortunately, SQLite in RStudio doesn't support the CONVERT() function.However, there is no direct support for specifying decimal precision in the CAST function. SQLite stores numeric values as REAL (floating-point) internally when they're cast to numeric types.

```{sql modifying previous case when to have integer students staff ratio}
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.university_name AS University,
    y.student_staff_ratio AS "Students:Staff",
    CAST(y.student_staff_ratio AS INT) AS "Students:Staff INT Cast",
    CAST(y.student_staff_ratio AS REAL) AS "Students:Staff Decimal Conversion",
    y.num_students AS "No.Students",
    y.pct_international_students AS "% International Students",
    y.pct_female_students AS "% Female Students",
    CASE 
        WHEN y.num_students < 10000 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN y.num_students BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN y.num_students > 20000 THEN 'Large'
        ELSE 'NA' 
    END AS Size
FROM 
    university u
INNER JOIN 
    university_year y
ON 
    u.id = y.university_id
ORDER BY 
    y.pct_international_students DESC;


```


```{sql looking at UoC score for 2015 and 2016, include=FALSE}
SELECT
u.university_name,
c.country_name,
rc.criteria_name,
ry.year,
ry.score
FROM university u
INNER JOIN country c ON u.country_id = c.id
INNER JOIN university_ranking_year ry ON ry.university_id = u.id
INNER JOIN ranking_criteria rc ON ry.ranking_criteria_id = rc.id
WHERE rc.criteria_name IN (
'Total Times',
'Total Shanghai',
'Total CWUR'
)
AND ry.year IN (2015, 2016)
AND u.university_name = 'University of Cambridge'
ORDER BY ry.score DESC;
```
