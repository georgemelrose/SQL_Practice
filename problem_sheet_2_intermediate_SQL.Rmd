\section{Introduction}

These problems aim to test your intermediate SQL knowledge, building on the basic SQL concepts tested in problem sheet 1. The questions and solutions are of a more esoteric nature than problem sheet 1 yet still useful as a SQL coder. For the purposes of this series of problem sheets, a database of dummy Marathon results data has been generated. More information on the \textbf{Marathon} database is presented below.

The concepts tested in this sheet are covered by the LinkedIn learning course \textbf{Intermediate SQL for Data Scientists} - (<https://www.linkedin.com/learning/intermediate-sql-for-data-scientists/>) .

\subsection{Useful Prepatory Resources}

In addition to this problem sheet, there are two useful resources you can draw upon to better understand these SQL concepts:

- \textbf{Two RMarkdown documents} - one to generate some dummy 'Universities' data (<https://github.com/georgemelrose/SQL_Practice/blob/main/0_generating_databasestar_dummy_data.Rmd>). This was copied from the excellent SQL learning resource databasestar (<https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_university/sqlite>). 

  The other document is an RMD HTML going over intermediate SQL concepts and how they can be applied to databasestar dummy data   (<https://github.com/georgemelrose/SQL_Practice/blob/main/03_Intermediate_SQL_for_Data_Scientists.html>). 
  
- \textbf{A video presentation} - a recording of a meeting in which I presented the \textbf{Intermediate SQL for Data Scientists} HTML , explaining varying higher level concepts- (<https://universityofcambridgecloud.sharepoint.com/sites/AD_Progress/SitePages/Learning-SQL-in-a-New-Format.aspx>). 

\subsection{Marathon Database}

Firstly, the data to be put into the Marathon database was formulated from the following Python script - (<https://github.com/georgemelrose/SQL_Practice/blob/main/Dummy_Marathon_Data/marathon_data_generation.ipynb>).

The \textbf{marathon data generation} python script generates the following tables:

\textbf{1. Runners} - Randomly generate 1000 runners with names common in their locale/country, together with their birth date and sex.

\textbf{2. Events} - The 6 Major World marathons (Berlin, Boston, Chicago,London,New York City, Tokyo), with an event per year from 2012 to 2023. 

\textbf{3. Results} - Gives results for runners in hh:mm:ss format, ensuring there aren't duplicate results for each runner per event. Prevents any results breaking either the male marathon world-record (2:00:35 Eliud Kipchoge 2023) or the female marathon world-record (2:11:53 Brigid Kosgei 2019). Also determines, with a True/False column, if a result is elite by the male standard (below 02:15:00) or the female standard (below 02:30:00).

\textbf{4. Sponsors} - Lists the following 10 major companies that typically act as sponsors to runners - "Nike", "Adidas", "Asics", "Saucony", "Hoka","Brooks", "New Balance", "Puma", "Under Armour", "Tracksmith". 

\textbf{5. Sponsored Athletes} - A table listing the fraction of the elite athletes that have a sponsor.

\textbf{6. Training Plans Descriptions} - The descriptions of 10 different training plans and their respective lengths in weeks. 

\textbf{7. Training Plans} - The training plans of athletes. Only 72% of runner-event combinations have an associated training plan.

\section{Intermediate SQL Problems}

\subsection{Indexes}

\textbf{Q1.} - Create a basic index on the runner_id column in the Results table to speed up searches and joins involving runner information?

\textbf{Q2.} - Construct a unique index on the event_id column of the Events table to ensure no duplicate event entries exist?

\textbf{Q3.} - Create a composite index on the runner_id and event_id columns in the Training_Plans table to improve performance for queries that frequently search for a specific runner's training plan for an event?

\textbf{Q4.} - Add a unique index on the first_name, last_name, and date_of_birth columns in the Runners table to ensure no duplicate runner profiles are entered, even if runners have similar names?

\textbf{Q5.} - Give the code to see all the indexes present?

\textbf{Q6.} - Give the command to see all the indexes associated with a particular table, for example 'Runners'?

\subsection{Views}

\textbf{Q1.} - Create a view of all male runners from the Baltic States? Also write code to display all the records from this view? \textbf{Hint -} most of the code is already present in problem sheet 1.

\textbf{Q2.} - Create a view and display its' records, of all the Nike sponsored runners?
